# üß¨ CAFA-6 Protein Function Prediction ‚Äî Data Analysis

This repository supports exploratory data analysis and model development for the **CAFA-6 Protein Function Prediction** competition on Kaggle.

Main work is performed in **`data_analysis.ipynb`**, using training and testing data from the competition dataset.

## üìö Dataset Description

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`Train/train_sequences.fasta`** | Contains **amino acid sequences** for proteins in the training set. Each sequence represents a known protein whose function (GO terms) has been annotated. |
| **`Train/train_terms.tsv`** | Maps each training protein to its corresponding **Gene Ontology (GO) terms**, representing experimentally verified protein functions. |
| **`Train/train_taxonomy.tsv`** | Provides **taxon IDs** (organism identifiers) for each protein in the training set. Useful for incorporating phylogenetic or organism-level features. |
| **`Train/go-basic.obo`** | The **Gene Ontology graph structure** in OBO format. Defines relationships between GO terms (e.g., ‚Äúis_a‚Äù, ‚Äúpart_of‚Äù) and provides the hierarchical organization used for semantic similarity and evaluation. |
| **`Test/testsuperset.fasta`** | Contains **amino acid sequences** for proteins on which predictions should be made (test set). These sequences lack GO annotations. |
| **`Test/testsuperset-taxon-list.tsv`** | Lists **taxon IDs** corresponding to proteins in the test set. Allows integration of taxonomy-aware prediction strategies. |
| **`IA.tsv`** | Provides **information accretion (IA)** values for each GO term. Used during evaluation to weight precision and recall, giving more importance to specific or informative terms. |
| **`sample_submission.tsv`** | Template file showing the **correct submission format** required for Kaggle. It lists protein IDs and example predicted GO terms. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage in Analysis

| Component | Typical Use in `data_analysis.ipynb` |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **FASTA files** | Parsed with `Bio.SeqIO` from Biopython to extract protein IDs and sequences. |
| **`train_terms.tsv`** | Joined with sequence IDs to build the training label set for supervised learning. |
| **`train_taxonomy.tsv` / `testsuperset-taxon-list.tsv`** | Used for grouping proteins by organism or exploring evolutionary signal. |
| **`go-basic.obo`** | Loaded via `goatools` to compute semantic similarity, term depth, and ontology-based metrics. |
| **`IA.tsv`** | Used for evaluation metrics that apply information-content weighting (e.g., weighted Fmax). |
| **`sample_submission.tsv`** | Used to verify correct output formatting before submitting predictions. |
